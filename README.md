# server sider

A \[ server-side / host-only \] mod that adds small gameplay changes.

## gameplay changes

> The configuration file is automatically reloaded at the start (and end) of each run.
>
> *[***OptionGenerator***](https://thunderstore.io/package/6thmoon/OptionGenerator/) *(+[***Risk Of Options***](https://thunderstore.io/package/Rune580/Risk_Of_Options/))* can be used to change the configuration in-game, rather than editing the file or using **r2modman**.*

Change | Effect | Enabled by default?
---    | ---    | ---
`rescueShipPortal` | Spawns a portal inside the *Rescue Ship* to allow looping after defeating *Mithrix*  | `true`
`voidFieldFogAltStart` | Changes the *Void Fields*' fog to only become active once a *Cell Vent* has been activated *(rather than on entry)* | `false`
