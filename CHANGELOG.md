## 1.6.1
- Change the default value for `chanceDollMessage` to `false`
    - ***Risk of Rain V1.3.6 [Seekers of the Storm Roadmap Phase 1 â€” Items & Elites]** introduces a vanilla implementation of this tweak*
        - `<color=#53ff00>{0} offered to the shrine and was greatly rewarded!</color>`, rather than `<style=cShrine>{0} offered to the shrine and was rewarded greatly!</color>`
            - *Supports second-person POV (i.e. uses "You" instead of player name)*
            - *Message is coloured green*
        - Can still be enabled, but the message will lose the second-person POV and be a bit nonsensical
            - ...`and was greatly rewarded greatly!`
        - Tweak will be retained in case of downpatching
